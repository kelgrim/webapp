This is a project which I use for learning to create a Rest Service with Spring boot

There's not really any practical uses for it, though it could be used as a test object for learning how to test rest api's. 

Currently the project contains the following:
- Simple Rest service which can be used to retrieve user and message information from an embedded H2 database
- Unit tests to test the different components of the application
- Cucumber tests to do an integration test on the API.
