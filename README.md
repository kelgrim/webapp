This is a project which I use for learning to create a Rest Service with Spring boot

Currently there's no practical use for it. I'm just using it to learn to work with Spring Boot, 
creating unit tests with JUnit in combination with Mockito. Also for using GIT Flow to have a good version control
and in the future using Travis CI to test builds and deploy.
